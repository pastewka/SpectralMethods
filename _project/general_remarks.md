# General remarks

## What you need before starting

The project will guide you through the process of writing your own MPI-parallel solver for the Navier-Stokes equations.
We will provide guidance for implementation details, but we will _not_ teach specific programmings skills.
Depending on your background, this means you may need to familarize yourself with a certain set of technologies.
In particular, we are assuming that you have some experience in working with the unix shell (bash).

We provide our own [Python tutorial](../_python). Another good resource for tutorials is [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/), e.g. on the [unix shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) or [Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/).

## What you need to pass the class

You need to submit a [final written report](your_final_report) at the end of the class. Throughout the milestones, we will indicate the
types of results that we want documented in the report. Note that we do not expect anything from the first milestones,
but once you have a working code we will ask you to compute certain physical problems.
