# Milestone 4: Aliasing

In the third milestone, you will run your second turbulence simulation. In this milestone, you will...

* ...learn how to eliminate aliasing.

Make sure you have read and understood the chapter on [discrete convolutions](../_lecture/discrete-fourier-transform.html).

## Aliasing

The simulations from [milestone 3](milestone03.md) likely suffer from aliasing errors. Correct aliasing with the $2/3$-rule.

## Parameters

Run simulations with the same parameters as your simulations of [milestone 3](milestone03.md), but this time with aliasing correction. Plot the energy spectrum without and with aliasing correction.

## Task summary

We ask you to provide the following results in your final report:

* Plot of the energy and the dissipation spectrum at 5 different times throughout your simulation; compare results with aliasing corrections and without
