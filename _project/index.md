# Project

## Submission of the project

Below you will find milestones for the project accompanying this lecture. The milestones guide you through the process of writing a spectral solver for the direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations.

## Technical notes

We recommend that you use the programming language [Python] for the project. It can be useful to initially use [Jupyter notebooks], but you will later on need to move a standalone Python code. The Python modules [numpy], [scipy] and [matplotlib] are useful for numerics and visualization. The milestone sheets and the learning materials contain instructions for implementation in Python. You can also develop your project in another programming language, but you will not receive any support or instructions from us.
